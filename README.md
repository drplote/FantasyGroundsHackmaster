Hackmaster 4e ruleset for Fantasy Grounds

Modifies the 2e ruleset to support Hackmaster 4th edition. Ideally I turn this into an extension rather than an entire ruleset, but I had a lot to get done in a short amount of time and this was way easier, so it is what it is. I'll see about converting it to an extension when it nears feature completion.
