Hackmaster 4e ruleset for Fantasy Grounds

Modifies the 2e ruleset to support Hackmaster 4th edition. Ideally I turn this into an extension rather than an entire ruleset, but I had a lot to get done in a short amount of time and this was way easier, so it is what it is. I'll see about converting it to an extension when it nears feature completion.

Unfortunately, I don't think it's legal for me to share my work with regards to Player's Handbook, Gamemaster's Guide, and Hacklopedia of Beasts data, so if you use this you're going to have to enter the data for weapons, armor, races, classes, spells, etc yourself. Using the 2E PHB, DMG, and MM on Fantasy Grounds as a basis and copying and modifying records is probably the easiest way to do that.
